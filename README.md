# Static Scratch 

This is a simple gulp static site build for liquid (or other) templates. It will be part of a quick demo for a larger proof of concept thing.

Github has a good enough editor for markdown with preview built in. If Travis will gulp and commit to pages, then everything should be in order.

todo: file a prose.io issue for file saves/commits not actually getting committed
