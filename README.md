This is a quick project to experiment with non-jekyll GitHub static site builds. 
The goal end game is to create something that lets you edit or add content, issue a PR, and let Travis build, test, and deploy to gh-pages.

  - gulp
  - handlebars
  - mocha -> chai (testing)
  - travis (deploys to gh-pages)
  - travis-ci (builds, tests, on success deploys to gh-pages)
